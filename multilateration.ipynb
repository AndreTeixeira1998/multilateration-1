    "Wnen a radio device transmits a signal it will propogate through the atmosphere at approximately the speed of light - that is, approximately v = 3e8m/s. \n",
    "\n",
    "If this message is received by two receivers (towers), the time difference of arrival (TDOA) between the first and second tower can be determined. TDOA = t<sub>1</sub> - t<sub>2</sub> where t<sub>1</sub> is the time the message is first received and t<sub>2</sub> is the time the message is recieved by the second tower. This TDOA can be used to determine the difference in distance that the transmitter is located from the towers. For example, assume that the transmitter is on a circle of radius d metres from tower 1, where it was received first. Then it must also be on a circle of radius d+v\\*TDOA metres from tower 2, where it was received second. Clearly the device must then be located at one of the intersections of the two circles.\n",
    "\n",
    "By iterating over a range of values for d and at each iteration finding the intersection of the two circles, a locus of possible transmitter locations can be generated. This turns out to be a hyperbolic curve."
